The Elastic Stack (formerly known as the ELK Stack) is a powerful collection of
softwares that lets you collect data from any source using any format. It gives
you tools to search, visualize and analyze these data in real time.

The ELK stack is based on three major components:

* **Elasticsearch**: a distributed full-text search engine, able to store JSON
  document and index them efficiently. It is responsible for the storage of all
  the incoming data.

* **Logstash**: a data processing pipeline, taking any source data as input. It
  is able to format and modify data on the fly before forwarding it to
  the chosen destination (usually an Elasticsearch database).

* **Kibana**: a powerful web-based data visualization tool providing
  everything you need to explore your data and build useful and efficient
  dashboards.

{% warning %}
Due to [Elasticsearch license change](https://www.elastic.co/fr/pricing/faq/licensing),
we are currently unable to provide versions of Elasticsearch higher than
`7.10.2`. Consequently, and following the [compatibility matrix](https://www.elastic.co/fr/support/matrix#matrix_compatibility)
provided by Elastic.co, we strongly advise to stick to the following versions:

| App      | Min. Version | Max. Version | Default  |
| -------- | -----------: | -----------: | -------: |
| Logstash | `6.8.0`      | `7.17.21`    | `6.8.21` |
| Kibana   | `7.10.0`     | `7.10.2`     | `7.10.2` |
| Curator  | `7.0.0`      | `7.0.1`      | `7.0.1`  |

Using our repos (which we also strongly advise) ensures you that these
constraints are respected.

## Deploying an ELK Stack

### Planning your Deployment

* Logstash and Kibana both require their own container(s). We
  will consequently need two apps.

* To keep things simple, we will deploy Elasticsearch as an addon attached to
  Logstash.

* Choosing the appropriate Elasticsearch plan strongly depends on your needs.
  In this guide, we will start with a Sandbox plan that you can upgrade or
  scale up later if need be.

* Logstash requires quite a lot of RAM to run properly. We recommend to deploy
  at least one L container to host it.
