## Deploying

### Using our One-Click Deploy Button

Click the One-Click Deploy button below to automatically deploy Kibana with
your Scalingo account:

[![Deploy](https://cdn.scalingo.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://dashboard.scalingo.com/deploy?source=https://github.com/Scalingo/kibana-scalingo)

{% note %}
* When using our One-Click Deploy button above, a new Elasticsearch database is
  provisionned and attached to your Kibana app. You can safely delete it if you
  use the one attached to your Logstash app.
* In such a case, the `ELASTICSEARCH_URL` must be retrieved from the previously
  created Logstash instance.
{% endnote %}

### Using the Command Line

We maintain a repository called [kibana-scalingo](https://github.com/Scalingo/kibana-scalingo)
on GitHub to help you deploy Kibana on Scalingo. Here are the few steps you
will have to follow:

1. Clone our repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Scalingo/kibana-scalingo
   cd kibana-scalingo
   ```

2. Create the application on Scalingo:

   ```bash
   scalingo create my-kibana
   ```

   Notice that our Command Line automatically detects the git repository, and
   adds a git remote to Scalingo:

   ```bash
   git remote -v

   origin   https://github.com/Scalingo/kibana-scalingo (fetch)
   origin   https://github.com/Scalingo/kibana-scalingo (push)
   scalingo git@ssh.osc-fr1.scalingo.com:my-kibana.git (fetch)
   scalingo git@ssh.osc-fr1.scalingo.com:my-kibana.git (push)
   ```

3. Create a few environments variables:

   ```bash
   scalingo --app my-kibana env-set BUILDPACK_URL="https://github.com/Scalingo/kibana-buildpack"
   scalingo --app my-kibana env-set ELASTICSEARCH_URL="<elasticsearch-db-url>"
   ```

4. Deploy:

   ```bash
   git push scalingo master
   ```

### Using the Terraform Provider

{% note%}
The following code blocks are given as examples.\
You will have to adjust some values to suit your needs.
{% endnote %}

1. Start by forking our [Kibana repository](https://github.com/Scalingo/kibana-scalingo)

2. Place the following block in your Terraform file to create the app:

   ```terraform
   resource "scalingo_app" "my-kibana" {
     name        = "my-kibana"
     force_https = true

     environment = {
       BUILDPACK_URL     = "https://github.com/Scalingo/kibana-buildpack"
       ELASTICSEARCH_URL = "<elasticsearch-db-url>"
     }
   }
   ```

3. Link the app to your forked repository:

   ```terraform
   data "scalingo_scm_integration" "github" {
     scm_type = "github"
   }

   resource "scalingo_scm_repo_link" "default" {
     auth_integration_uuid = data.scalingo_scm_integration.github.id
     app                   = scalingo_app.my-kibana.id
     source                = "https://github.com/<username>/kibana-scalingo"
     branch                = "master"
   }
   ```

4. Run `terraform plan` and check if the result looks good
5. If so, run `terraform apply`
6. Once Terraform is done, your Kibana instance is provisioned and ready to
   be deployed. This requires an extra manual step:

   1. Head to [your dashboard](https://dashboard.scalingo.com/apps/)
   2. Click on your Kibana application
   3. Click on the **Deploy** tab
   4. Click on **Manual deployment** in the left menu
   5. Click the **Trigger deployment** button
   6. After a few seconds, your Kibana instance is finally up and running!


## Setting the Indexes up

Once deployed, index patterns need to be configured. This allows Kibana to know
which indices of Elasticsearch it has to watch.

{% assign img_url = "https://cdn.scalingo.com/documentation/elk/index-creation.png"%}
{% include mdl_img.html %}

In the above example, the `unicorns-*` pattern is used.

Click on create and you're all set, the test input done in the previous section
should appear in the Discover tab of Kibana dashboard.

{% assign img_url = "https://cdn.scalingo.com/documentation/elk/success.png" %}
{% include mdl_img.html %}


## Updating

By default, Scalingo deploys a version of Kibana that is compatible with the
Elasticsearch instances we provide.

Consequently, updating Kibana only consists in triggering a new deployment of
your instance.

{% note %}
* Scalingo provides a version of Kibana that is compatible with the latest
  Elasticsearch 7.10.x version. Our repository won't be updated as long as we
  are [stuck with this constraint]({% post_url platform/getting-started/getting-started-with-elk/2000-01-01-overview %}).
* However, you can use the dedicated environment variable [see below](#environment)
  to deploy a specific version of your choice.
{% endnote %}

### Using the Command Line

1. In your Kibana repository, create an empty commit and push it to Scalingo:

   ```bash
   git commit --allow-empty -m "Update Kibana"
   git push scalingo master
   ```

### Using the Terraform Provider

1. Head to [your dashboard](https://dashboard.scalingo.com/apps/)
2. Click on your Kibana application
3. Click on the **Deploy** tab
4. Click on **Manual deployment** in the left menu
5. Click the **Trigger deployment** button
6. After a few seconds, your updated Kibana instance is ready!


## Customizing

### Environment

The following environment variable(s) can be leveraged to customize your
deployment:

- **`KIBANA_USER`**\
  Username for Kibana authentication.

- **`KIBANA_PASSWORD`**\
  Password for Kibana authentication.

- **`KIBANA_VERSION`**\
  Version of Kibana to deploy.\
  Defaults to `7.10.2`

- **`ELASTICSEARCH_TLS_CA_URL`**\
  URL of the CA certificate used to established a TLS connection with the
  Elasticsearch database. Can be found on the database dashboard.\
  Mandatory if you enabled the force TLS option on your Elasticsearch database.\
  Defaults to not being set.

- **`ES_SSL_VERIFICATION_MODE`**\
  If you're using a custom hostname not handled by the TLS certificate, please
  set this environment variable to `none`.\
  Defaults to not being set.
