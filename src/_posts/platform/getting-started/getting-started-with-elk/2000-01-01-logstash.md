## Deploying Logstash

### Using the Command Line

We maintain a repository called [logstash-scalingo](https://github.com/Scalingo/logstash-scalingo)
on GitHub to help you deploy Logstash on Scalingo. Here are the few steps you
will have to follow:

1. Clone our repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Scalingo/logstash-scalingo
   cd logstash-scalingo
   ```

2. Create the application on Scalingo:

   ```bash
   scalingo create my-logstash
   ```

   Notice that our Command Line automatically detects the git repository, and
   adds a git remote to Scalingo:

   ```bash
   git remote -v

   origin   https://github.com/Scalingo/logstash-scalingo (fetch)
   origin   https://github.com/Scalingo/logstash-scalingo (push)
   scalingo git@ssh.osc-fr1.scalingo.com:my-logstash.git (fetch)
   scalingo git@ssh.osc-fr1.scalingo.com:my-logstash.git (push)
   ```

3. Scale the container to an L size:

   ```
   scalingo --app my-logstash scale web:1:L
   ```

4. Attach the Elasticsearch addon:

   ```bash
   scalingo --app my-logstash addons-add elasticsearch elasticsearch-sandbox
   ```

5. Edit the `logstash.conf` file to change the index name of the Elasticsearch
   output. The goal is to make it fit semantically to the data being ingested:

   ```
   output {
     elasticsearch {
       [...]
       # OLD
       index => "change-me-%{+YYYY.MM.dd}"
       # NEW
       index => "unicorns-%{+YYYY.MM.dd}"
     }
   }
   ```

   Don't forget to commit your changes:

   ```bash
   git add logstash.conf
   git commit -m "Update the index name"
   ```

6. Create a few environment variables to protect your Logstash instance via 
   HTTP basic auth (not everyone should be able to send data to your instance!):

   ```bash
   scalingo --app my-logstash env-set USER=my-username
   scalingo --app my-logstash env-set PASSWORD=my-password
   ```

7. Everything's ready, deploy to Scalingo:

   ```bash
   git push scalingo master
   ```

8. You can now try to send some data to your Logstash instance:

   ```bash
   curl --request POST 'https://my-username:my-password@my-logstash.osc-fr1.scalingo.io?name=whatever' --data 'Hello World!'
   ok
   ```

   Check the indices that are stored in the Elasticsearch database:

   ```bash
   scalingo --app my-logstash run bash

   > curl $SCALINGO_ELASTICSEARCH_URL/_cat/indices
   yellow open unicorns-2024.06.04 _0XNpJKzQc2kjhTyxf4DnQ 5 1 1 0 6.6kb 6.6kb
   ```

   Logstash has created the unicorn index which can now be requested:

   ```bash
   > curl $SCALINGO_ELASTICSEARCH_URL/unicorns-2024.06.04/_search | json_pp
   {
      "_shards" : {
        // [...]
      },
      // [...]
      "hits" : {
        "total" : 1,
        "max_score" : 1,
        "hits" : [
          {
            "_type" : "logs",
            "_score" : 1,
            "_source" : {
               "name" : "whatever",
               "message" : "Hello World!",
               "url" : "?name=whatever",
               "@timestamp" : "2024-06-04T11:57:03.155Z"
               // [...]
            },
            // [...]
          }
        ]
      }
    }
    ```

   The result of the above search contains a document having with a field
   `name` set to `whatever` and a field `message` set to `Hello World!`.

## Updating Logstash

By default, Scalingo deploys a version of Logstash that is compatible with the
Elasticsearch instances we provide.

Consequently, updating Logstash only consists in triggering a new deployment of
your instance. To do so, create an empty commit and push it to Scalingo:

```bash
git commit --allow-empty -m "Update Logstash"
git push scalingo master
```

{% note %}
* Scalingo provides a version of Logstash that is compatible with the latest
  Elasticsearch 7.10.x version. Our repository won't be updated as long as we
  are [stuck with this constraint]({% post_url platform/getting-started/getting-started-with-elk/2000-01-01-overview %}).
* However, you can use the dedicated environment variable [see below](#environment)
  to deploy a specific version of your choice.
{% endnote %}


## Customizing your Logstash Deployment

### Configuring Logstash

The cloned boilerplate used to deploy your Logstash instance comes with a
directory named `config`. All the files contained in this directory are copied
in the Logstash configuration directory at runtime, allowing you to precisely
customize your instance.

For example, if you want to edit the logging behavior of Logstash, edit the
`config/log4j2.yml` file:

```bash
git add config/log4j2.yml
git commit -m "Update how Logstash is logging"
git push scalingo master
```

### Environment

The following environment variable(s) can be leveraged to customize your
deployment:

- **`USER`**\
  Logstash administrator account name.

- **`PASSWORD`**\
  Logstash administrator password.

- **`LOGSTASH_PLUGINS`**\
  Comma separated [list of plugins](https://github.com/logstash-plugins) to
  install.\
  Defaults to not being set.

- **`LOGSTASH_VERSION`**\
  Version of Logstash to deploy.\
  Defaults to `6.8.21`
