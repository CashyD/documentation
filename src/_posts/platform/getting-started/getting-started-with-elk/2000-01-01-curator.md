## Deploying

{% note %}
FIXME
The following instructions 
Curator can be deployed on your existing Logstash instance.
{% endnote %}

1. Curator is written in Python. Consequently, the first step consists of
   adding the Python buildpack to the `.buildpacks` file present in your
   Logstash repository. The file must end up like this (order is important!):

   ```text
   https://github.com/Scalingo/buildpack-jvm-common
   https://github.com/Scalingo/python-buildpack
   https://github.com/Scalingo/logstash-buildpack
   ```

2. To instruct the Python buildpack to install Curator and its dependencies,
   create a file named `requirements.txt` at the root of your Logstash
   repository:

   ```text
   elasticsearch-curator==7.0.1
   ```

3. To configure the connection to the ElasticSearch database, create a file
   named `curator.yml` with the following content:

   ```yaml
   ---
   client:
     hosts:
       - ${ELASTICSEARCH_HOST}:${ELASTICSEARCH_PORT}
         username: ${ELASTICSEARCH_AUTH_USERNAME}
         password: ${ELASTICSEARCH_AUTH_PASSWORD}

   logging:
     loglevel: INFO
     logfile:
     logformat: default
   ```

4. To configure the database indices lifecycles, create a file named
   `log-clean.yml` with your instructions. The example below asks Curator to
   consider indices prefixed by `LOGS_INDICES_PREFIX` and to remove those older
   than `LOGS_RETENTION_DAYS` days:

   ```yaml
   actions:
     1:
       action: delete_indices
       description: Delete old log indices
       options:
         ignore_empty_list: True
         disable_action: False
       filters:
         - filtertype: pattern
           kind: prefix
           value: ${LOGS_INDICES_PREFIX}
         - filtertype: age
           source: name
           direction: older
           timestring: '%Y.%m.%d'
           unit: days
           unit_count: ${LOGS_RETENTION_DAYS}
   ```

5. The configuration files mention several environment variables. The next
   steps consist in creating them, depending on your deployment method. First,
   let's identify them and their values:

   - `LOGS_RETENTION_DAYS`: retention period of logs, expressed in days.
   - `LOGS_INDICES_PREFIX`: indices prefix that helps identify logs affected by
     the policy. If you are following our guides, the value should be
     `unicorns-`
   - `ELASTICSEARCH_HOST`, `ELASTICSEARCH_PORT`, `ELASTICSEARCH_AUTH_USERNAME`
     and `ELASTICSEARCH_AUTH_PASSWORD` must be retrieved from the value of the
     existing `ELASTICSEARCH_URL`. To do so, remember that it is made of
     several components separated one from each other by a delimiter, like so:

     ```text
     http://[user]:[password]@[host]:[port]
     ```

4. Once done, create a file named `curator.yml` with the following content:

   ```yaml
   ---
   client:
     hosts:
       - ${ELASTICSEARCH_HOST}
         username: ${ELASTICSEARCH_AUTH_USERNAME}
         password: ${ELASTICSEARCH_AUTH_PASSWORD}

   logging:
     loglevel: INFO
     logfile:
     logformat: default
   ```

5. Now you have to configure your indices life cycle. This is based on your
indices names.
Create a file named `log-clean.yml`. This configuration parses the indices
names stored in Elasticsearch and removes the ones that are too old.

```yaml
actions:
  1:
    action: delete_indices
    description: Delete old log indices
    options:
      ignore_empty_list: True
      disable_action: False
    filters:
    - filtertype: pattern
      kind: prefix
      value: ${LOGS_INDICES_PREFIX}
    - filtertype: age
      source: name
      direction: older
      timestring: '%Y.%m.%d'
      unit: days
      unit_count: ${LOGS_RETENTION_DAYS}
```

You now need to add two environment variables:

```
LOGS_INDICES_PREFIX=unicorns
LOGS_RETENTION_DAYS=10
```

The first environment variable is `LOGS_INDICES_PREFIX`. It configures the
index pattern that should be affected by this policy. Setting this variable
to `unicorns` prevent Curator from deleting the other indices that are stored
in the same database.

The second environment variable is `LOGS_RETENTION_DAYS`. It configures
the retention time of your logs (in days). Setting this variable to `10`,
Curator will delete an index if it is 10+ days old.

### Scheduling the Curator Task

Curator is not a daemon, it is designed as a one-off process. To be able
to run it on Scalingo you can leverage our [Scheduler](https://doc.scalingo.com/platform/app/task-scheduling/scalingo-scheduler).

At the root of your Logstash directory, create a file named `cron.json` to
setup your recurring task. The following example starts curator everyday at
03:00 (3 AM) and 15:00 (3 PM):

```json
{
  "jobs": [
    {
      "command": "0 3,15 * * * curator --config curator.yml log-clean.yml"
    }
  ]
}
```

The last step is to trigger a new deployment of your Logstash instance by
pushing your changes to your Scalingo remote.
